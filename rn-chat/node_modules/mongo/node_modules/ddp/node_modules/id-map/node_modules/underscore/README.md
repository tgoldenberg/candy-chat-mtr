This package is stripped from [meteor/underscore](https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/underscore) and made compatible with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).

**Note:** This package is only for client-side usage.

**Note:** This is not identical to the actual `underscore@1.5.2` in NPM.

```js
var _ = require('underscore');
```
